Object: It is the instance through which we can access the properties and values and it is the most important data type 
        that forms the bulding blocks in the javascript.Everything in real time is an object.
        Examples:car,fan,Chair,bike,keyboard etc...

       * Objects are collection of key value pairs.These keys can be variables or functions and are called as properties
         and methods.
  
         Example: If an object is a student, it will have properties like name,age,data of birth,Roll number etc...


syntax representation of object:

         let objectname= {};//empty object


Example 1:  If an object is a student, it will have properties like name,age,data of birth,Roll number etc...

         let student= new object();

          student.name= "Hemanth";
          student.age=21;
          student.rollnumber="11189H012";


Example 2: If an object is a car,it will have properties like brand,model,year etc...
        
         let car= new object();
         car.brand="ford";
         car.model="mustang";
         car.year=1969;
