HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

Definition: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol(HTTP) is to accomplish the way to transfer the data from client to server.

example: When we use computer,mobile phone or laptop devices in home.The HTTP server which is a web host running
         web server software such as Apache or Internet Information Services (IIS).when we access a website,our
         browser send a request to the corresponding web server and it responds with an HTTP status code.


Difference Between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:

HTTP/1.1: * A connection can be reused,which can save time and no longer needed to be opened multiple times to display
            the resources embedded in the single document.
          
          * pipelining also added and this allows a second request that to be sent before the  answer to the first one
            was fully transmitted.due to this the latency of communication is lowerd.
   
          * Expands on the catching support by using additional headers like cache-control,conditional headers like 
            if match and by using entity tags.

          * content negotiation like language,encoding and type were introduced.A client and server could now agree on
            exchange of contents.

          * Thanks to the host header and the ability to host differnt domines from the same IP address allowed server
            collocation.

HTTP/2: * It is a binary protocol and it can not be read and create manually.
      
        * It allows the implementation of the improved optimization technique.

        * It does not change much in terms of caching.With the server push feature if the client finds the resources
          that are already present in the cache, it can cancle the pushed stream.

        * HTTP/2 is a multiplexed protocol and the parllel requests can be made over the same connection, removing 
          the constraints of the HTTP/1.x protocol. 

        * From the previous versions of security concerns are continue to be seen in the http/2. It is better equiped
          to deal with them due to the new TLS features like connection error type security.
